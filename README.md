# Portfolio

## Description

The goal for this project was to put into use all the new coding skills I've learned. This was a diffcult challenge for me. I had many challenges with making the links work. 

## Usage

This website is a visual portfolio of my current work. I have images that will take you to the links of my github repository, my first project, and my most current project. Besides live links, images, and navigation bar.
