        <h2>About</h2>

        <section id="About">
            <p>Hello, my name is Urie Williams although I prefer to go by Ri. I started my coding journey in December of
                2023 and was immedeitly hooked. I wanted to learn more about the tech world through computer programing.
                When I started my first assignment I was very confused and frusterated that I wasn't understanding why
                or how anything was working. Eventually when I did get the result I was looking for I felt a huge rush
                of emotion and excitement that my code finally worked. That feeling of hard work to then triumph was
                exilerating. I wanted more challenges. For myself the learning process doesn't get any easier infact the
                more questions I ask the more I have, however this journey has been very fufilling so far and I look
                forward to more and exciting challenges!</p>
